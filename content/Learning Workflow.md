### Replacing Notion with Obsidian

In Obsidian, you can capture ideas, manage tasks, track progress, and even structure your workflow, all without needing to switch to Notion. Here’s how you can adapt each aspect:

1. **Idea Jotting & Free-Form Writing**
    
    - Continue to use **daily notes** for free-form thinking and writing, where you can capture random thoughts, ideas, inspirations, and even research material.
    - Use **templates** to quickly set up note structures if needed (but still keep them flexible). For example, a "daily idea dump" template can help you quickly create a new note every day.
2. **Tracking Learning Progress**
    
    - Use **Obsidian's backlinking and tagging** system to track your progress on specific learning goals or projects without rigid structure.
    - Create **project-based notes** where you jot down what you're learning, and link those notes to the resources, ideas, or specific articles you've come across.
    - Use **tags** like `#in-progress`, `#learning`, `#completed`, or `#books` to mark the status of various projects or concepts.
3. **Organizing Your Work**
    
    - You can use **Obsidian’s graph view** to visually see connections between your notes and ideas over time. This helps you recognize patterns and connections naturally.
    - Instead of using tables or databases like in Notion, you can rely on **internal links** to connect different notes and build a web of knowledge that grows over time.
4. **Tracking Resources and Articles**
    
    - Instead of saving bookmarks in Notion, you can either save them directly in **Obsidian** or import them from **Raindrop**.
    - **Web Clipper** (or other similar plugins) can allow you to quickly import online articles, PDFs, or research into Obsidian.

### Obsidian Plugins to Support the Workflow:

To help you move everything into Obsidian smoothly, here are some plugins you might want to use:

#### 1. **Daily Notes Plugin**

- **Built-in Feature**: This plugin lets you create a new note each day with a customizable template. You can set it to automatically create daily notes for you, making it easy to jot down new ideas or thoughts every day.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for your free-form writing and idea dumping.

#### 2. **Templates Plugin**

- **Built-in Feature**: This plugin allows you to create templates for notes, tasks, and more. You can quickly insert a predefined structure (e.g., a "study session template" or "brainstorming template") into any new note.
- **Use Case**: Quickly set up new notes for your different writing or learning activities while keeping flexibility.

#### 3. **Tags Plugin**

- **Built-in Feature**: Tags allow you to label your notes with relevant keywords (e.g., `#learning`, `#ideas`, `#books`). Tags are flexible and provide an easy way to track the themes of your notes.
- **Use Case**: Use tags to track your current learning topics, status of your projects (e.g., `#in-progress`), or themes you're exploring.

#### 4. **Tasks Plugin**

- **Plugin**: Tasks plugin helps you track to-do lists and tasks within Obsidian. You can create checklists within notes and keep track of tasks related to your projects.
- **Use Case**: If you need to break down learning goals or project tasks, you can create simple task lists directly in your notes.

#### 5. **Kanban Plugin**

- **Plugin**: If you want a more visual way to track progress (instead of using Notion’s boards), the Kanban plugin allows you to create boards for your projects.
- **Use Case**: Create project boards for different learning projects or areas of focus. You can use this for managing your progress without having to create rigid structures.

#### 6. **Web Clipper (or Markdown Web Clipper)**

- **Plugin**: The Web Clipper plugin allows you to save web pages directly into Obsidian as notes, either as plain text or a fully formatted version. This is great for saving articles, blog posts, or research.
- **Use Case**: Save research or articles you want to read later and bring them directly into Obsidian for future reference.

#### 7. **Obsidian Publish (Optional)**

- **Plugin**: If you're into sharing your notes or making them public, the Obsidian Publish plugin lets you turn your notes into a website. It's optional, but you can use it to publish a "learning journal" or share knowledge with others.
- **Use Case**: If you ever want to make your learning process or notes public, this plugin is an easy way to create an online version of your Obsidian vault.

#### 8. **Zotero Integration Plugin**

- **Plugin**: If you use Zotero for managing citations and references, this plugin lets you import your Zotero library directly into Obsidian.
- **Use Case**: If you’re doing research or reading books/articles, this allows you to track and connect your references to your notes.

#### 9. **Linking Your Thinking**

- **Plugin**: This is a community plugin that makes it even easier to create deep, meaningful links between your notes and visualize your ideas in a more structured way.
- **Use Case**: Perfect for linking concepts, books, quotes, and other thoughts together in a non-linear manner.

### New Simplified Workflow in Obsidian:

1. **Jot down ideas** freely in **Daily Notes** each day.
2. Use **Tags** to quickly label important themes, ideas, or projects you’re working on.
3. Link ideas using **backlinks** naturally. If you come across an article or resource, add it to your notes, and use the **Web Clipper** plugin to bring in relevant content.
4. **Track your progress** with **Tasks** and **Kanban** for any active projects or learning goals.
5. Regularly review your **graph view** to visually see how your thoughts and notes are connecting over time.

### Summary:

You can definitely **cut Notion** from the equation and make **Obsidian** your central hub for all aspects of your learning and idea-juggling process. The **plugins** above will help you create a flexible, fluid system where you capture, connect, and track your learning without needing a rigid structure. The key is to embrace Obsidian’s linking and tagging system while using plugins to support your specific needs for tracking and managing progress.
